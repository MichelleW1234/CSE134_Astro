			<h2>The Fascinating World of Fish</h2>
			<img src = "../../images/fish1.jpeg">
			<p>
				Fish are some of the most diverse and ancient creatures on Earth. 
				With over 34,000 known species, they inhabit oceans, rivers, lakes, and streams, 
				showcasing an incredible variety of shapes, sizes, colors, and behaviors. From tiny 
				neon tetras to massive whale sharks, fish have adapted to nearly every aquatic environment.
			</p>
			<h2>A Glimpse into History</h2>
			<p>
				Fish are among the earliest vertebrates, appearing over 500 million years ago. Over time, 
				they evolved a wide range of adaptations for survival in water, including gills for extracting oxygen, 
				fins for swimming, and specialized scales for protection. Some fish, like lungfish, even developed the 
				ability to survive briefly on land, hinting at the evolutionary journey toward amphibians and beyond.
			</p>
			<h2>Diversity of Species</h2>
			<p>
				Fish come in countless forms. Sharks and rays, cartilaginous fish, are known for their streamlined bodies 
				and predatory skills. Bony fish, which make up the majority of species, include everything from colorful reef 
				fish to deep-sea dwellers with bioluminescent features. Each species is uniquely adapted to its habitat, diet, and lifestyle.
			</p>
			<h2>Behavior and Communication</h2>
			<p> 
				Fish communicate in subtle ways. Some use visual signals, like color changes or fin displays, to attract mates or warn rivals. 
				Others use sound, electric signals, or chemical cues to interact. Many fish display fascinating social behaviors, including schooling 
				for protection and coordinated hunting techniques.
			</p>
			<h2> Importance in Ecosystems </h2>
			<p>
				Fish play crucial roles in aquatic ecosystems. They help control insect and plankton populations, serve as prey for larger animals, and 
				contribute to nutrient cycling. Coral reef fish, for example, help maintain the health of coral by grazing on algae, preventing overgrowth 
				that can suffocate the reef.
			</p>
			<h2>The Wonder of Fish</h2>

			<p>
				Observing fish can be mesmerizing—their fluid movements, dazzling colors, and unique behaviors offer a glimpse into a world vastly different 
				from our own. Fish remind us of the incredible adaptability of life and the beauty of the natural world beneath the water’s surface.
